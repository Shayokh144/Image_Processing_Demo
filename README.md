# Image_Processing_Demo
This project is about some basic image processing tasks like filtering, erosion, dialation. Here, on image,  
i)Roberts operator 
ii)Max filtering 
iii)Min filtering  
iv)Prewitts operator  
v)Median filtering   
vi)Gaussian blur operator  
vii)Erosion  
viii)Dilation  
ix)opening  
x)closing  
xi)Boundary detection 
operatinos are done without help of library function.

Language: OpenCV, cpp
