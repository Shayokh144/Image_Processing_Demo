# Image_Processing_Demo
This project is about some basic image processing tasks like filtering, erosion, dialation. Here, on image,  

1. Roberts operator 
2. Max filtering 
3. Min filtering  
4. Prewitts operator  
5. Median filtering   
6. Gaussian blur operator  
7. Erosion  
8. Dilation  
9. opening  
10. closing  
11. Boundary detection 
operatinos are done without help of library function.

Language: OpenCV, cpp\n
